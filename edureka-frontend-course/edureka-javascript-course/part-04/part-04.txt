# Datatypes => 

The process of creating any variable and assigning it a value is known as defining the variable and the variable is known as defined variable.

* Premitive datatypes =>
    i. number => It is used to represent numeric values like integers or decimal/floatin-point numbers.
    eg: 1, 2, 3, 4, -1, -2, -3, 1.0, 2.99
    keyword variableName = valueOfVariable;
    var/let age = 30;

    ii. string => It represents sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
    eg: "pranjal", 'gogoi'
    keyword variableName = valueOfVariable
    var/let student = "Pranjal Gogoi"

    iii. boolean => represent true/false values.
    eg: true, false
    var isLoggedIn = true;
    var isLoggedIn = false;

    iv. undefined => An undefined variable is the one where it has been created but not assigned any value.
    eg: var variableName;
    let num;

    v. null => null is a value that represents or amounts to nothing.
    keyword variableName = null;
    let/var value = null;

    vi. bigIng => Integers will fall beyong the range of number datatype.
    eg: 123456890676328
    var/let bigNumber = 123437530957820809n

# typeof => which we use to check datatype of our variable.
eg: console.log(typeof variableName)
