# Event and event handling

# event => Whenver a change in state happens we say an event occured

event => moved

* events => 
click, 
double click, 
mouse over event => When our mouse pointer enters an element's boundaries.
mouse out event => Mouse pointer leaves element's boundaries.
keypress event => When we type a character, when we press down a key.
submit event => When a submit button is clicked or a form is submitted.
change event => Whenever a value of an particular element changes it is refered as change event.

eg: When we write text in input/textarea or select something in dropdown.


# what happen when an event occurs ?
Our browser will create an event object and this object will contain info about our event.

click = {
    typeOfevent : "event",
    elementfired: "h1",
    .....
    .....
}

We can write javascript code to use this object and perform task

# Event handlers => Functions or properties in js that are used to respond to specific events for ex click, dbclick, submit.

# html elements will be associated with these functions and properties or in general event handlers.

* elements => event handlers.

* property event handlers => 
* functional event handler => addEventListner => functions that are executed when an event occurs

addEventListner("eventName", function(){
    // lines of code
    // lines of code
})
