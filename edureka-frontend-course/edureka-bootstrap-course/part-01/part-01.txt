we use bootstrap to make our website responsive.

bootstrap: - It is a framework in css that we can use in our project to make our elements responsive and styled as per our need.

With bootstrap we have classes, which we can add to our tag and bootstrrap will automatically style the tag.

containers => they are the layout options that helps us to store our content.

div => h1, span, button

to use bootstrap containers => we have two classes => container and container-fluid

bootstrap grid => rows and columns, every bootstrap row can have a maximum of 12 cols
 
width of the columns : col-1 this means it is going to take 1/12 part of our entire row.
